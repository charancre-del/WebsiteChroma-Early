# Chroma Early Start - Day One GHL Operational Guide

Welcome to the new Admissions Pipeline powered by GoHighLevel (GHL) and the Chroma Care Model website. This guide outlines exactly what happens when a new family inquiries about our services and what actions are required from Center Directors.

## The Patient Journey: From Click to Clinic

When a parent submits a form on `chromaela.com` (e.g., "Schedule a Tour" or "Contact Us") or initiates a webchat, the following automated sequence is triggered instantly:

### 1. Instant Lead Capture & Routing
- The family's information (Name, Phone, Email, Child DOB, Primary Diagnosis, etc.) is pushed securely into the GHL CRM.
- A new **Contact** is created, and an **Opportunity** is generated in the `Admissions Pipeline` under the `New Inquiry` stage.
- **Urgent Routing**: If the family indicates high urgency, a task is automatically flagged as High Priority.

### 2. "Speed to Lead" Automation
- Within **2 minutes**, the system automatically sends a friendly SMS and Email acknowledgment to the parent:
  > *"Hi [Name], thank you for inquiring with Chroma Early Start! We received your request and a Center Director will be reaching out shortly. In the meantime, you can explore our approach here..."*
- This immediate touchpoint drastically increases connection rates and shows families we care.

## Required Actions for Center Directors

As a Center Director, your goal is to transition families from `New Inquiry` to `Tour Completed` as smoothly as possible.

### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
- **New Inquiries**: Must be called within **1 business hour** of receipt.
- **Webchat Messages**: Must be responded to within **15 minutes** during business hours.
- **No-Shows**: Must be moved to the `No-Show Reschedule` sequence by the end of the business day.

### Your Daily Workflow
1. **Log into GHL (LeadConnector)**: Start your day by checking the `Conversations` tab for any overnight webchats or SMS replies.
2. **Review the Admissions Pipeline**: Check the `New Inquiry` column. 
3. **Make the Call**: 
   - Before calling, review the Contact's **Notes** to see what page they converted on and their specific clinical needs (e.g., ABA vs Speech).
   - If they answer: Great! Book the tour directly on your GHL Calendar and move their Opportunity card to `Tour Scheduled`.
   - If they don't answer: Leave a voicemail, log the call, and leave the card in `New Inquiry`. The system will continue a light nurture sequence.
4. **Tour Management**:
   - The system will handle **48-hr, 24-hr, and 2-hr automated reminders** (SMS & Email) to prevent no-shows.
   - Once a tour finishes, manually move their card to `Tour Completed`. This triggers the automated sending of Digital Intake and HIPAA Consent forms.

## Understanding Custom Fields & Tags
When speaking to a family, you will notice rich data pre-populated in their profile:
- **Tags**: Look for tags like `Source: Website`, `Interest: ABA`, or `Location: Duluth`. These help you personalize the conversation instantly.
- **Custom Fields**: Verify the `Child Date of Birth` and `Current Therapies`. If any data is missing, update it manually during your call.

By adhering to this pipeline and utilizing the new Chroma Care Model automations, we ensure every family receives a premium, immediate, and compassionate onboarding experience.
